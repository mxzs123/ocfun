// Empty stub for 'service-worker.js' to satisfy bundlers during development/build.
// Some libraries import 'service-worker.js' directly; in Next.js we usually place
// service workers under `public/` and register them via `navigator.serviceWorker.register(...)`.
// This no-op module avoids bundling errors in our demo setup.
